India has grown coffee for over 350 years. It has consumed it in its own inimitable way — strong, sweet, chicory-blended, poured from a height — for just as long. What it did not have, until recently, was a specialty coffee culture in the contemporary sense.

That changed swiftly, and the transformation is still underway.

## The First Cafes

The early 2010s saw a cluster of openings that would prove significant in retrospect. Bangalore, the city that would become India's specialty coffee capital, saw its first serious third-wave cafes appear alongside IT parks and startup offices.

These were not the chain cafes that had arrived in the late 1990s — themselves significant in normalising cafe culture, but serving primarily milk-based drinks with little focus on origin. The new wave was different: single-origin offerings, manual brewing methods, trained baristas, and an explicit focus on sourcing transparency.

Blue Tokai, founded in Delhi in 2012, was among the first to roast and retail single-estate Indian coffees at scale. Their early messaging was simple and powerful: this coffee comes from a named estate in Coorg or Chikmagalur, and you can taste the difference.

## Growing a Market

The challenge was not sourcing good coffee — India had exceptional estates, growing exceptional coffee, much of it leaving the country unrecognised. The challenge was convincing consumers to pay more for it.

This required education as much as product. The early specialty cafes functioned almost as classrooms, with baristas explaining varietals, processing methods, and brewing ratios to curious customers. Coffee literacy grew slowly, then quickly.

Social media accelerated everything. A new generation of coffee enthusiasts documented their discoveries, building communities online that translated into footfall offline. Coffee had become a culture, not merely a beverage.

## The SCA's Role

The Specialty Coffee Association's growing presence in India formalised what was becoming an industry. The Q-Grader certification programme — the global standard for coffee evaluation — created a community of trained evaluators who could apply consistent international standards to Indian coffees.

The SCA's cupping protocols gave Indian roasters and buyers a shared language with the global specialty trade. Coffees could now be evaluated not merely by commodity grade but by sensory quality: aroma, flavour, aftertaste, acidity, body, uniformity, sweetness, clean cup, and overall impression. A score above 80 on the SCA 100-point scale denotes specialty. India's best coffees were consistently scoring 85 and above.

This created a virtuous feedback loop: higher scores justified higher prices, which gave estate owners incentive to invest in quality processing and handling, which produced better coffees, which scored higher.

## Where Things Stand

India now has hundreds of specialty roasters, from micro-operations running weekend roasts to multi-city chains with substantial roasting facilities. Cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, and Chennai have mature specialty cafe scenes. Hyderabad, Pune, Kolkata, and Kochi are following rapidly.

The estates themselves have transformed. Many have built their own micro-processing facilities, experiment with fermentation, and maintain direct relationships with roasters rather than selling exclusively through commodity brokers. The language of specialty — varietals, processing, altitude, microclimates — is now spoken fluently on the farm.

## What Remains

What has not yet completed is the loop between Indian producers and Indian consumers. The majority of India's finest coffees still leave the country. The domestic market, while growing rapidly, has not fully claimed the quality its own soil produces.

That reckoning is coming. And it will be worth waiting for.
