There is nothing quite like Araku Valley in the world of specialty coffee. Nestled at 900–1,100 metres in the Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh, it is home to roughly 70,000 tribal families who have cultivated coffee in dense, shade-grown forests for generations — without pesticides, without synthetic fertilisers, without the vocabulary of "organic" or "specialty."

They simply grew coffee as their ancestors had taught them. The world is only beginning to take notice.

## A Cooperative Born from Necessity

The Naandi Foundation, a development organisation, began working with Araku's Adivasi communities in the early 2000s. The goal was livelihood development. Coffee, which had been grown here since the 1940s but largely sold as low-grade commodity, seemed like an opportunity.

What followed was a decade of meticulous work: soil health programmes, wet processing infrastructure, cupping labs, and direct relationships with international roasters. The Araku Coffee brand was created to represent this collective — putting tribal growers directly in conversation with the specialty market.

## The Land and Its Flavours

Araku's coffees are almost entirely Arabica, grown under dense forest canopy. The biodiversity of the Eastern Ghats — rare orchids, endemic birds, ancient forests — creates a complex ecosystem that influences cup character at every elevation.

Typical Araku profiles feature:

- Floral aromatics — jasmine, honeysuckle, sometimes rose
- Stone fruit sweetness — peach, apricot, nectarine
- A gentle, rounded acidity
- Clean, extended finish

The processing at Araku has evolved significantly over the past decade. Early lots were primarily washed. Today, the cooperative produces natural and honey-processed coffees that have attracted considerable international attention, particularly in France and Australia.

## The Paris Boutique

Araku Coffee opened a flagship boutique in Paris in 2017 — before it had established significant retail presence in India. This was a deliberate statement: Araku coffee deserved to stand alongside the world's best single origins.

The Paris opening generated considerable attention in the specialty press. A coffee from a tribal cooperative in Andhra Pradesh, occupying a considered space in the city that has long defined luxury goods, priced among the world's finest specialty offerings. The story was irresistible — and the coffee itself matched the narrative.

Since then, Araku has won multiple awards at the Golden Bean competition in Australia, and the cooperative's lots regularly score above 85 on the SCA cupping protocol.

## What Araku Represents

Araku is not merely a coffee origin. It is a proof of concept: that specialty coffee can be an instrument of equitable development, that tribal communities can maintain sovereignty over their land and labour while accessing premium global markets, and that quality and ethics need not be in tension.

For the Indian specialty coffee movement, Araku Valley carries outsised significance. It demonstrated that India could produce coffees compelling enough to command premium prices — not for novelty, but for genuine, measurable quality.

The next chapter for Araku is the domestic market. As Indian coffee consumers develop greater sophistication, the idea of drinking world-class Indian coffee on Indian soil — paying what it is worth — becomes increasingly important. That conversation is ongoing.
