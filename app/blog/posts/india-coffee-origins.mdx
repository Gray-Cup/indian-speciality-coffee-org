Coffee arrived in India not through commerce or conquest, but through an act of devotion — and perhaps smuggling. Sometime in the 17th century, a Sufi saint named Baba Budan returned from his pilgrimage to Mecca with seven raw coffee beans concealed in his beard. He planted them in the hills of Chikmagalur, Karnataka.

Those seven beans grew into India's first coffee plantation. Today, the region around Baba Budan Giri — the mountain that bears his name — remains one of India's most revered coffee origins.

## Coffee Under the British Raj

The British East India Company recognised the commercial potential early. By the 1840s, commercial coffee cultivation had taken root across Coorg, Chikmagalur, and the Nilgiris. The 1850s saw a significant boom — the coffee estates established during this era still shape India's coffee landscape today.

India became a significant exporter, shipping primarily to Britain and Europe. Robusta cultivation expanded rapidly after the Coffee Leaf Rust epidemic of 1869 devastated Arabica crops across Asia, and India adapted accordingly.

## The Indian Filter Legacy

While much of India's output was destined for export, a distinctly Indian coffee culture developed in the South. Chicory-blended filter coffee, brewed in traditional brass filters and served in stainless steel tumblers and davara — this was not a European transplant but an Indian creation, adjusted to local tastes, local water, and local rituals.

The morning filter coffee in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka is not merely a beverage. It is ceremony.

## Monsoon Malabar: A Flavour of History

India's most unusual coffee emerged from the colonial shipping era. Green beans transported to Europe in wooden hulls would absorb moisture from the sea air, swelling and losing their acidity. The British preferred this mellow, low-acid cup.

Today, Monsoon Malabar is deliberately produced by exposing green beans to monsoon winds on the Malabar Coast — a controlled recreation of that maritime journey. The result is a heavy-bodied, low-acid coffee with earthy, musty, and woody character unlike anything else in the world of specialty.

## What Makes Indian Coffee Distinct

India's geography creates remarkable diversity. The Western Ghats — a UNESCO World Heritage biodiversity hotspot — provide altitude, shade cover, and complex soil profiles across Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. The Eastern Ghats, home to Araku Valley, offer a completely different terroir.

Coffee in India grows alongside pepper, cardamom, and vanilla; the co-cultivation under dense shade creates subtle spice notes that are uniquely Indian. The biodiversity of the estates is part of the cup character.

## The Modern Specialty Movement

For decades, India's finest coffees left the country unrecognised. Estate owners sold green beans to commodity brokers; the specialty qualities were invisible at origin.

This changed in the early 2010s. A generation of young Indians, many educated abroad, returned with exposure to third-wave coffee culture. They began buying directly from estates, investing in roasting equipment, and opening cafes that celebrated origin rather than obscured it.

The Coffee Quality Institute's Q-Grader programme and the Specialty Coffee Association's growing presence in India provided technical frameworks. Araku Valley's wins at international competitions put India firmly on the global specialty map. And the conversation has not stopped since.
